# Language-Detection
Language detection refers to the process of automatically identifying the language of a given text or document. This is an important task in natural language processing and is used in many applications, such as language translation, content filtering, and search engines.

There are several techniques used for language detection, including
*   Built in Packages
*   Machine learning algorithms

Creating your own language model and using it to detect the language. This method is more time-consuming and requires more resources than using a built-in package, but it provides more control over the language detection process.This step involves 3 ways 

*   Statistical Analysis
*   Machine Learning algorithms
*   Deep Learning
